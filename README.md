This repository is for frontend using react-bootstrap and react-router-dom

# for backend visit https://github.com/MazDot/BamdadProject

# what the app can do:
* register/login/logout users using jwt tokens
* adding products as a seller
* viewing products as a customer and seller
* dynamic view for product pages
* product searches by category name

# how to clone this repository:
* open terminal and type: git clone https://github.com/MazDot/BamdadFrontend.git
* cd into the new folder and type: npm install
* To run the React project, type: npm start

# since backend is local as well, products in carousels are empty after cloning for the first time, clone the backend 
as well and run it according to its structures in README.txt to have your database ready - start by registering a user 
(choose seller in order to add products to database) - add some products so database has data to show in homepage and
other parts of app.
